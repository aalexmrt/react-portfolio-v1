          Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with over 3 years of experience in the tech
          industry, originally from Spain but now based in Colombia. Recently,
          Iâ€™ve been working remotely with a talented team of developers at a

          I really enjoy coding and solving real-world problems, and I love
          building amazing designs while enhancing user experience. Iâ€™m flexible
          and open to learning any tech stack needed to address the requirements
          of the project.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl">
